#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
var- var is old style, var can reassigned any where.
let- let included on ES6, let work on block scoped, it's reassignedable but cannot redeclareable.
const- const work on block scoped, it's cannot reassigned and redeclare

map()- map() Function create a new array, it's loop on array all elements.
forEach()- forEach() Change on original array, it's loop on array all elements.
filter()- filter() Create a new array, it's finding on lot of data.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
It's a short and simple function system. This is syntax =>.

Destructuring makes my code clear and easier.
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
const [a, b, c] = numbers

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Template literals sing (``). It's handling Multi line string. 
concatenation string is  messy and difficult to read, especially when combining many variables and fixed strings.
